The objective of this project is to carry out a complete text classification analysis on a dataset of 1.1K tweets and train a neural network model that identifies tweets' content types. There are 4 possible output labels: sports, entertainment, medical, politics. The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/pradeeptrical/text-tweet-classification).
