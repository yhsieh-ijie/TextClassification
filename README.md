This is the first text classification project I carried out in order to train a neural network model that could identify the tweet content type.


The training data was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/pradeeptrical/text-tweet-classification). As the dataset is quite small, I was able to do hypterparameters tuning and run 432 models in order to find the model that works the best among all.
